Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip),
and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.
Round the result to the nearest integer.

Example
meal_cost = 100
tip_percent = 15
tax_percent = 8


A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value 123 and return from the function.

Function Description
Complete the solve function in the editor below.

solve has the following parameters:

int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tip_percent: the tip percentage
int tax_percent: the tax percentage
Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

There are 3 lines of numeric input:
The first line has a double, meal_cost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
The second line has an integer, tip_percent (the percentage of meal_cost being added as tip).
The third line has an integer, tax_percent (the percentage of meal_cost being added as tax).
